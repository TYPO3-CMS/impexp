				<source>Native Import/Export module for TYPO3 data. Can export single records, content of tables, single pages or whole branches of the page tree. Includes attached media like image and preserves relations between records. Exports only to TYPO3 specific format, either a binary format (.T3D) or XML. The format is meant for exchange between TYPO3 systems.</source>

			<trans-unit id="export.description" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>To export TYPO3 T3D/XML files you click any record icon or page in the page tree (including the root page!), select "More options" (requires the extensions "extra_page_cm_options" to be installed) and then "Export to .t3d". This will bring up the export interface where you can configure options for your export session.</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id="export.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>There are a number of methods by which you can export data from TYPO3:
- Export a single page or branch of the page tree (use page icon context menu)
- Export a single record from any page (use record icon context menu)
- Export all records from a specific table on a specific page (using the Web&gt;List module)
- Export an arbitrary selection of records from the clipboard (using the Web&gt;List module)

The export format observes all TYPO3s methods for relations between the records in the export file. But you will have to configure how these relations are maintained, at least to some degree. Sometimes you would want to include records referred to, at other times you surely want to keep the original mapping. That depends on your objectives with the export.

Regardless of your configuration for export you will always see a complete reflection of all chosen records and their internal relations in the preview display found in the bottom of the export module page.

				<source>Configure the tables from which you want to include records that are found as relations in the main export configuration.</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id="inclRelations.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>Background: When you export a record in TYPO3 it might contain relations to other records in the system. You have to tell the export interface what to do with these relations. Basically there are three scenarios:
- If relations are found between records that are all in the export configuration, there is no problem: The relations are automatically mapped to the new id's of those records when imported.
- If the records related to are not included the relation will be lost (indicated with an error message in the preview) unless you a) either select that table in this selector box in which case all relations to that table will be included or b) if you set the table as a static table (in which case the relation is untouched and imported as-is - but which will of course break if no record with that UID is found in the import system).

&lt;b&gt;Soft References:&lt;/b&gt; Soft references are when a record contains pointers to external files or records but in fields where there are no formal relation configured. Examples of this is when a content element contains a "&amp;lt;link 123&amp;gt;" tag that represents a link to the page 123. This is not picked up formally as a reference, but is found anyhow as a "soft reference". The same goes for &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; tags with images from eg. "fileadmin/".
By default soft references pointing to records or files will act as normal references; either including the referenced item or showing an error. However you can also choose to exclude the handling of individual soft references or maybe set the value as "editable" upon import. This is done with a selector box in the export preview.</source>

			<trans-unit id="inclRelations.image_descr" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>This example shows tree examples of references; a) an image attached to a content element, b) a relation to a frontend usergroup UID, and c) a soft reference found in the bodytext field of a record, here it is the link-tag pointing to the page with UID 1.
Notice in the previous image how the relation to the frontend user group was lost. This has been corrected in this screenshot where the fe_group table has been selected in the list of table for which to include relations. The result is that the frontend usergroup is included as a record outside the exported pagetree. If you wanted to keep the relation but not include the usergroup you have to set "fe_groups" as a static table instead. See below.
This example shows a TypoScript Template Record where multiple soft references has been found. The first one is an email address. Here it is configured to be editable. This means that upon import the user will have a chance to edit the value before the import is actually done. This is very useful when exported files are used as templates. Another example includes a PHP script which we don't want to include in the export and therefore we have selected the exclude option for the soft reference.</source>

			<trans-unit id="staticRelations.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>By default all relations to static tables in TYPO3 are kept untouched. Of course those static tables should be present in the import system in order for this to work correctly. However there might be circumstances where you move information between two systems where theoretically non-static tables should just keep relations untouched. Examples could be "sys_languages" or TemplaVoila data structures / template objects where two systems might contain the same set of records in those tables while you are importing pages and content elements freely.</source>

			<trans-unit id="staticRelations.image_descr" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>In this example you see how a number of records are pointing to a System Language record which will become lost relations when imported because the record is not included in the export. However; in the target system the System Languages are exactly the same and therefore you just want a static mapping of the relations.
The static mapping is obtained by selecting the "sys_language" table as a static template meaning that the relations are kept at their current values assuming that they will be exactly the same in the target system when imported.</source>

				<source>You can export your records to a TYPO3 specific binary format (serialized PHP array) called "T3D".

			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id="fileFormat.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>Generally you should use the T3D format, preferably compressed. The T3D compressed format normally yields a size about 10 times less than the XML format which is bloaded due to the plain-text nature of the format.

With "Max size of files to include" you can set a limit to the size of attached files to records. This is useful if you have large PDF files or videoclips attached to records which you do not desire (or do desire!) to include; then with this limit you can adjust whether they are allowed in or not.

Entering a file name to save to makes it possible to write your export directly to a file (pressing "Save to filename") instead of downloading it (pressing "Download export"). The correct file extensions depending on file format is automatically applied. Files are saved in a proper filemount in "fileadmin/". This is shown to you upon saving.

To make sure that no records are lost during the import, you can make yourself safe by importing into a SysFolder you create first. After the import you can move all records to the final destinations. An example of such a scenario is if you configured the export to include relations; In that case a number of records may follow the export outside the page tree structure you are exporting. To make sure that all of these external records are written to the database, importing into a SysFolder is a good idea.

				<source>By default the import operation inserts new records in the system. Using this option will update existing records.</source>
			</trans-unit>
			<trans-unit id="update.details" xml:space="preserve">
				<source>There are certain requirements you have to meet if you want the "Update" process to work. The main thing is that the records updated are those with the SAME uid as the uid in the export file. Thus an update operation only makes real sense if the export and import systems are somehow related and the same UIDs can be expected in both ends. Otherwise it will be a mess!

When you update page structures the import operation will automatically try to rearrange records so they also appear in the same hierarchy and order as in the export file. This can be disabled by checking the option "Ignore PID differences globally". In any case you can set individual records to Ignore/Respect the PID with a selectorbox in the preview.

In the preview display you can also select if individual records should be flatly ignored during import or if you want them created as new records instead of being updates.
As a help for managing updates the preview display will inform you about the path where the existing element with that UID is found. Use this to verify that you get what you expect!

&lt;b&gt;Forcing the UID:&lt;/b&gt;
If you intend to update a system and some elements from the import are not mappable to a UID already (ei. does not exist) you can choose in the preview display to force the UID during creation. This is an unorthodox thing to do since UIDs are normally created automatically by the database. The option makes most sense if you are trying to "synchronize" a copy of another system. The option may mess up certain database internals and the feature is therefore only available for admins.</source>

When a structure has been imported you will see a difference view of all records which tells you whether the written content matched the import data or if not, what changed. In many cases content &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; change (eg. relations and file references) so it is not an error if you see red and green values. Basically the difference view is a feature you can use for visual validation of the import success. It brings piece-of-mind to those who is enlightened to understand what it tells... :-)
Green strings represent the actual written data while red represents the original value from the import file and black represents data that is the same.

&lt;b&gt;Allow to write banned file extensions (eg. PHP scripts), if any&lt;/b&gt;
Also an option for admins-only; Allows PHP-files (for example from soft references in TypoScript templates) to be written to the system. This is normally not allowed behavior for security reasons.</source>
