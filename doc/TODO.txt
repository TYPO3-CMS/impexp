Input Charset conversion NOTE:
	- T3D + XML/PHP4: Traverse array and convert proper places (meta data, header summaries, record values)
		- Serialized/binary content in fields may be mal-formed?
	- XML/PHP5: May be converted automatically without we can do anything.
		- May break encapsulated text files which are not base64 encoded
		- May break serialized strings

General:
- Add an "alias" field to tt_content elements (unique for the PAGE like the "pid" field). [I'm not clear anymore about what this should be used for... - maybe anchors in links to content elements? I guess so...]

IMPORT:
- Better logging to system
