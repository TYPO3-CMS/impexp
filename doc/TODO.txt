General:
- Add an "alias" field to tt_content elements (unique for the PAGE like the "pid" field). [I'm not clear anymore about what this should be used for... - maybe anchors in links to content elements? I guess so...]
- Cronjob script which can export selected presets?

Export of files:
- Include all files from a path like fileadmin/xxx/

Import of files:
- Optional folder to import files in (fileadmin/)
- If file exists on import, optional if it should be written?

IMPORT:
- Better logging to system

TemplateArchive:
- Add the modfunc module which will import a template from archive.
	- Project group for this?
	- Available repositories:
		- typo3.org text list?
		- Local configuration of URLs in localconf.
	- Available templates
		- Apache file list
			file / icon / description.txt
		- index.php gives XML with
			- file-ref (rel/abs)
			- icon-ref (rel/abs)
			- title / description
			- testUrl

NOTES:
*********
Input Charset conversion NOTE:
	- T3D + XML/PHP4: Traverse array and convert proper places (meta data, header summaries, record values)
		- Serialized/binary content in fields may be mal-formed?
	- XML/PHP5: May be converted automatically without we can do anything.
		- May break encapsulated text files which are not base64 encoded
		- May break serialized strings

Size limit:
- The import/export module may die (without warnings!) if the amounts of data becomes too large. For instance a file of 12Mb could not be handled with 32 MB ram configured for PHP. Of course the max_exec_time may also expire during a large import/export.
