TODO
************
General:
- fe_group: -1/-2 must be handled in both import/export
- Imp/Exp for non-admins?
- Include a path from fileadmin/xxx/
- BUG: Export, where some pages were outsite the page tree those pages were NOT created (but other records were)
- References inside of text fields such as bodytext-fields and simple link-fields are NOT detected. This includes:
  - RTE images
  - references to "fileadmin/" files from bodytexts/link-fields (eg. in template resources and links)
  - references to other pages from bodytext/link-fields with page-id's
  (Re-writing of included files from fileadmin/xxx/ should be mappable also if they are imported in other directories!)
- Option: Store content as XML instead of serialize()
- Have the option of importing records by *syncronization* to existing records! This could include a "diff" display where you can see what differences there would be and then select which records/fields in records should be updated.
- Add an "alias" field to tt_content elements (unique for the PAGE like the "pid" field). [I'm not clear anymore about what this should be used for...]
- Add thumbnail + description for an exported file.

  
IMPORT:
- merging.
- relation mapping to non-static records (fx. to "sys_language" table)

EXPORT:
- check read permissions! (record/table)
- add "list" parameter to incoming command-array (so you can export all records from a certain (or more) pids)
- add "remove" checkbox to structure display (so you can exclude specific records)
- add links in the web>list module to export (general for tables, specific for current display - like CSV button)
- clipboard export
- Add registration of extension from the export computer
